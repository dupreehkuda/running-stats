# Running Statistics

**Disclaimer: I don't have enough data but I'm literally working on it**

I just wanted to analyze some of my running data, such as average pace per n-th km, average time for each kind of run and so on

Maybe in future I will predict my lazyness (or my runs) with just a weather prognosis...
